# ChainWave  

**ChainWave** is a cutting-edge platform designed to simplify the management of multichain assets and streamline token swaps. By integrating advanced authentication, seamless cross-chain functionality, and user-friendly workflows, ChainWave addresses the complexity of operating in multichain environments.

## Features  

- **Quick Authentication**:  
  ChainWave leverages **Worldcoin** and **MetaMask** for fast and secure user authentication. User identities are securely linked using **Sign Protocol**, binding the World ID with the wallet address.

- **Real-Time Notifications**:  
  With **Push Protocol**, users receive instant price change alerts, ensuring they stay informed about market conditions.

- **Asset Overview**:  
  Integration with **Blockscout** provides users with a comprehensive view of their on-chain assets.

- **Flexible Swap Execution**:  
  - **Automated Mode**: Automatically executes swaps based on predefined conditions, such as price thresholds, and notifies the user upon completion.  
  - **Manual Mode**: Sends notifications to users, allowing them to manually decide whether to execute the swap.

- **Cross-Chain Asset Transfers**:  
  ChainWave ensures seamless cross-chain swaps using:  
  - **Uniswap** to convert tokens into USDC on the originating chain.  
  - **Circle CCTP** to burn USDC on the originating chain and mint it on the target chain.

- **Single-Chain Swaps**:  
  Uses **Uniswap** to swap tokens directly on the same chain.

- **Intuitive UI Design**:  
  Incorporates **Nouns designs** to enhance user experience and make workflows more intuitive.

## How It Works  

1. **Authentication and Registration**:  
   - Users log in with Worldcoin ID and MetaMask.  
   - Wallet addresses are securely linked with World ID via Sign Protocol.  

2. **Price Monitoring and Notifications**:  
   - Push Protocol keeps users updated with critical price changes.

3. **Swap Execution**:  
   - **Automated Mode**: Swaps are executed based on preset conditions.  
   - **Manual Mode**: Users receive alerts and decide whether to proceed.

4. **Cross-Chain Workflow**:  
   - Convert tokens to USDC using Uniswap.  
   - Burn USDC on the originating chain via Circle CCTP.  
   - Mint USDC on the target chain, completing the transfer.
